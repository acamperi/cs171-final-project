Michael Huntley, David Campos
Cinematch: An Interactive Movie Database Visualizer
Due to time conflicts, we met outside of the design studio and only Dennis Sun from our group and Michael Huntley were present.

## Comments ##
- What about an overall ranking system? Or safest schools/most dangerous schools, filterable by highest crime types. - M Huntley

Having an overall ranking system or means of filtering through different categories would be a great way to provide some storytelling information. We hope to include this as a detail visualization, in which schools selected by this search are highlighted on the map.

- Q: What is the ideal user? - M Huntley
- A: Students/ parents choosing colleges, college students & anyone interested in universities. - D Sun
- R: Security administrations might find this information useful. - M Huntley

The other group agreed that the information we present is pertinent to individuals we want to target, and M Huntley also provided us with an additional group to think about when making design decisions. Although it's difficult to know exactly how to make data most useful for security administrators, perhaps having demographics about the prevalence of time or comparisons of on-campus crime to off-campus crime might be useful as a proxy for measuring how good a job campus security is doing.

- The detail view probably works better underneath than to the side of the map. - M Huntley

Originally we thought of perhaps putting the detail view to the right of the map, but this would cause some issues regarding the overall readability of our detail visualizations due to the already highly horizontal nature of the map. Thus we'll likely have the detail view below the map.

- Things you could add: search, rankings, a searchable table with a variety of different sorting options - M Huntley

We hope to add all of these elements and more in our future visualizations.

- For four people, it seems like not enough... - M Huntley

While perhaps the current visualization is a bit sparse, we hope to include more different ways of interacting with the data (as described above) to make this project truly one that feels like four people worked together to complete it. The number and variety of different visualizations created, as well as the huge scope of the data from multiple sources (crime, financial aid, endowment, student demographics) will allow us to create a variety of different visualizations. One of these might include scatter plots to check for correlations between crime & different university vs. state data.
