# College Campus Security

- Data can be found in two places. In `raw/` we have the raw CSV and XLS files pulled from our data sources (various Department of Education websites), and in `data/` we have the processed data that the visualization itself uses (in addition to topographical data of the US taken from HW4).
- The project uses several libraries. Some of them are imported dynamically on the client's browser (e.g. d3, topojson, queue, underscore.js) and others are saved on the server and sent with the webpage to the client (e.g. jQuery).
- Our code is found on the top level, in the various html/css/js files at the root of the project directory.
- The Process Book can be found at the root of the project, in the `Process Book.pdf` file.
